# Molecule Localization

### Data Generation ###
See README file in ./data_generation for generation guide.

Here is a example dataset of Gaussian PSF images with size 64x64 (./data_generation/TrainingSet_deepLoco_iso_64.mat.zip). Ready to be used in network.
### Using deepLoco for localization ###
Current network is for 64x64 images.
1. Run train.py for training.
2. Run test.py for testing.
